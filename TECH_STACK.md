## Architecture Overview

StudyBuddy follows a modern microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components. The application is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a RESTful API backend, enabling scalability, maintainability, and flexibility for future enhancements.

### System Architecture

The system architecture consists of several key layers that work together to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining security, performance, and scalability.

**Presentation Layer:** The frontend React application serves as the user interface, providing an intuitive and responsive experience across desktop and mobile devices. This layer handles user interactions, state management, and communication with the backend API.

**API Gateway Layer:** The Flask backend serves as the API gateway, handling all client requests, authentication, authorization, and routing to appropriate service endpoints. This layer implements security measures, request validation, and response formatting.

**Business Logic Layer:** Core application logic is implemented within the Flask application, including user management, study room coordination, AI integration, document processing, and payment handling. This layer ensures business rules are enforced and data integrity is maintained.

**Data Access Layer:** Database operations are handled through SQLAlchemy ORM, providing abstraction from the underlying database implementation and enabling easy migration between different database systems if needed.

**External Integration Layer:** Integration with external services such as OpenAI, payment processors, and video conferencing platforms is handled through dedicated service modules that provide abstraction and error handling.

## Backend Technologies

### Core Framework

**Flask 3.1.1**
Flask serves as the primary web framework for the StudyBuddy backend. Flask was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem of extensions. The lightweight nature of Flask allows for rapid development while providing the necessary features for building robust web applications.

Flask's modular design through blueprints enables clean code organization and separation of concerns. Each major feature area (authentication, study rooms, AI integration, etc.) is implemented as a separate blueprint, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

Key Flask extensions used include:
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.1.1:** Provides ORM capabilities and database abstraction
- **Flask-CORS 6.0.0:** Enables cross-origin resource sharing for frontend-backend communication
- **Flask-Migrate:** Handles database schema migrations (when needed)

### Database and ORM

**SQLAlchemy 2.0+**
SQLAlchemy serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, providing a high-level abstraction for database operations. The choice of SQLAlchemy enables database-agnostic code that can work with various database backends including SQLite for development and PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.

**SQLite 3.x (Development)**
For development and prototyping, SQLite provides a lightweight, file-based database solution that requires no additional setup or configuration. This enables rapid development and easy testing without the overhead of managing a separate database server.

**Database Schema Design:**
The database schema is designed with normalization principles while maintaining performance considerations. Key entities include:
- Users with authentication and profile information
- Study rooms with membership and session tracking
- Documents with processing status and metadata
- AI conversations with message history
- Payment records and subscription status

### Security and Authentication

**PyJWT 2.10.1**
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide stateless authentication mechanism that scales well across distributed systems. JWTs contain encoded user information and are signed with a secret key to prevent tampering.

**Werkzeug Security**
Werkzeug's security utilities provide password hashing using industry-standard algorithms. The implementation uses secure password hashing with salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and ensure password security even if the database is compromised.

**Bleach 6.2.0**
HTML sanitization library that prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by cleaning and validating user input. All user-generated content is processed through Bleach to remove potentially malicious HTML and JavaScript.

**Input Validation and Sanitization**
Comprehensive input validation is implemented at multiple layers:
- Client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- Server-side validation for security and data integrity
- Database constraints for final data validation

### API and Communication

**RESTful API Design**
The backend implements a RESTful API following industry best practices for resource naming, HTTP methods, and status codes. This provides a clean, predictable interface for frontend consumption and potential third-party integrations.

**JSON Data Format**
All API communication uses JSON format for both requests and responses, providing a lightweight and widely-supported data exchange format that works seamlessly with JavaScript frontends.

**Error Handling and Logging**
Comprehensive error handling ensures graceful degradation and meaningful error messages for both users and developers. Logging is implemented throughout the application to aid in debugging and monitoring.

### Document Processing

**PyPDF2 3.0.1**
PDF processing library that enables text extraction from uploaded PDF documents. This extracted text is used for AI-powered features such as summary generation, flashcard creation, and content analysis.

**Python Multipart 0.0.20**
Handles multipart form data for file uploads, enabling users to upload documents, images, and other files to the platform.

### HTTP Client and External APIs

**Requests 2.32.5**
HTTP library for making requests to external APIs including OpenAI, payment processors, and other third-party services. Requests provides a simple, elegant interface for handling HTTP operations with proper error handling and timeout management.

## Frontend Technologies

### Core Framework

**React 19.1.0**
